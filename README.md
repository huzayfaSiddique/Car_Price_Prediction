This project focuses on predicting the prices of used cars based on features like brand, fuel type, kilometers driven, and car age. Since the target variable (price) was right-skewed, a log transformation was applied for better model performance. I used a ColumnTransformer to handle preprocessing — applying OneHotEncoding to categorical columns, scaling to numeric ones, and log transformation where needed. Then, I trained and fine-tuned Ridge and Lasso Regression models using GridSearchCV with cross-validation. The final models were evaluated using the R² score after converting predictions back to their original scale.
